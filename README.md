# ai_text_classification: Text Classification Using NLP and Transformers

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a text classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models. Leveraging the BERT model from Hugging Face's transformers library, the system is designed to classify text data into binary categories.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The project has a labeled dataset with text samples and corresponding labels. This dataset should be split into training and validation sets.

### Example Data Format
```text
Text: "The movie was great"
Label: 0

Text: "The movie was not that great"
Label: 1
```
- **Label 0**: Represents the first class (e.g., negative sentiment, spam).
- **Label 1**: Represents the second class (e.g., positive sentiment, not spam).

## Model Architecture
The project uses the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for sequence classification. The model is fine-tuned on a binary classification task using a labeled dataset.

## Training
The model is trained using a simple training loop:

1. **Data Loading**: The text data is tokenized using BERT's tokenizer and loaded into a PyTorch DataLoader for batching.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: The BERT model is fine-tuned on the dataset using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5.
3. **Epochs**: The model is trained over multiple epochs, with validation accuracy evaluated after each epoch.

## Evaluation
After each epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation dataset. The primary evaluation metric used in this project is accuracy.

### Example Output
```text
Epoch 1, Validation Accuracy: 0.5000
Epoch 2, Validation Accuracy: 0.5000
Epoch 3, Validation Accuracy: 0.5000
```

## Results
The final model's performance on the validation set can be used to assess its ability to generalize to new data. If necessary, adjustments to the model architecture or training process can be made to improve accuracy.

## Usage
To use the trained model for predictions on new text data:

1. Tokenize the new text using the BERT tokenizer.
2. Pass the tokenized data through the trained model.
3. The model outputs logits, which can be converted to class predictions.

```python
new_texts = ["New example sentence"]
inputs = tokenizer(new_texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
logits = model(**inputs).logits
predictions = logits.argmax(dim=1)
print(predictions)
```

# ai_text_classification: Text Classification Using NLP and Transformers

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a text classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and transformer-based models. Leveraging the BERT model from Hugging Face's transformers library, the system is designed to classify text data into binary categories.
